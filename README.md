# PenguinsCantFly
A fully developed game application with an appealing GUI built in Python and the PyGame GUI module that allows users to control the penguin and dodge the enemies!

## Description
You can use the left and right arrow keys to control the penguin. The goal is to fall as deep as you can without being hit by the sharks. If hitting a cloud, the penguin will rebound on it and the bouncing power will depend on the penguin's velocity falling down. As the current score becomes higher, the sharks will start to speed up simultaneously!
